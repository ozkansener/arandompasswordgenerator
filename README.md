# Strong Long Random Password Generator

We all use passwords in our lifes but short passwords can be easily hacked by hackers who perform a bruteforce attack for example.
One way of how we can defend against (some times multithreaded) bruteforce attacks and other error trail password guessor (except a timeout ban) is to have a strong password.

This tool provides such a password that is long and random and contain characters that some other random password generator do not provide.
To make this password generator even better you can add characters from other languages such as russian arabic greek because most know brute force tools that are opensource don't scan for these characters.
